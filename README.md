 'Talkative Planet'

You SHOUT words to destroy asteroids before they crash into your planet! What could be more FUN!

##  Game Overview

You are a peaceful planet floating in the vast cosmos. Suddenly, a deadly rain of asteroids threatens to destroy your world! But there's hope - these asteroids carry mysterious words, and by typing them correctly, you can destroy them before impact.

##  How to Play

1. **Asteroids** will fall from space with words written on them
2. **Type the word** exactly as shown on the asteroid
3. **Destroy asteroids** before they reach your planet
4. **One collision** = Game Over!
5. **Survive as long as possible** and achieve the highest score!

##  Scoring System

- **Word Length**: Longer words = more points (10 points per letter)
- **Asteroid Size**: Larger asteroids = bonus points
- **Survival Time**: The longer you survive, the higher your score

##  Technologies Used

- **React 18** - Main framework
- **React Router** - Navigation between pages
- **CSS Modules** - Component-scoped styling
- **CSS Animations** - Smooth asteroid movement and effects
- **Google Fonts** - Space-themed typography (Orbitron, Exo 2)
